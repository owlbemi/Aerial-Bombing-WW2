# Aerial-Bombing-WW2
## Data Analysis Project: Aerial Bombing Operations during WWII
### Introduction
The purpose of this project was to gain insight into the circumstances surrounding aerial bombing operations carried out during World War II. In furtherance of this purpose, our group obtained data released by the United States Airforce consisting of digitized paper mission reports from WWII. The data was retrieved from kaggle.com, and contains 46 variables and 178,282 occurrences. Each record includes the date, country, geographic location, and other data elements, spanning from 1939 to 1945. Only data from Allied Powers are recorded, including U.S. and Royal Air Force data, in addition to some Australian, New Zealand and South African air force missions.
